ðŸ“± Task-8: Unveiling the Android App Market â€“ Oasis Infobyte Internship ðŸ“Š

As part of my Data Science & Machine Learning Internship at Oasis Infobyte, I completed Task-8, where I explored and analyzed the Google Play Store dataset to uncover market trends, user preferences, and pricing patterns.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview:

The aim was to perform data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain actionable insights into the mobile app ecosystem, helping developers and businesses make data-driven decisions.

ðŸ›  Steps Involved:

ðŸ”¹ Data Cleaning â€“ Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and converted price/installs into numerical formats.
ðŸ”¹ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Visualized app ratings, installs, prices, and category trends using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
ðŸ”¹ Market Insights â€“ Identified top app categories, most installed apps, rating patterns, and price distributions.
ðŸ”¹ Comparative Analysis â€“ Compared paid vs. free apps and examined how pricing impacts ratings and installs.

ðŸ’¡ Key Insights:

âœ” Most popular app categories dominate downloads, but niche categories often achieve higher average ratings.
âœ” Paid apps are less common, and their prices vary widely depending on the category.
âœ” The highest install counts are concentrated among free apps in entertainment, communication, and social media.

Tech Stack: Python | Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Data Cleaning | EDA
